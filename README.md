Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

Description
In this project, you'll use Python to investigate data on bike share systems in three major American cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You'll develop code to import the data and use descriptive statistics to answer fascinating questions about it. You'll also construct an interactive experience in the terminal to present these information by writing a script that takes in raw input.

List of software, firmware and hardware you may require. You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda A text editor, like visual code. A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

Files used
The following file contains necessary code: bikeshare.py The following files are not uploaded to remote repo by using .gitignore because the files are too big: 1 chicago.csv, 2 new_york_city.csv, 3 washington.csv.

Credits
Pandas documentation is very usefull. Numpy documentation. (if needed). Python documentation for controlflow. If I have doubts about the errors occured while running the code I used: www.stackoverflow.com
